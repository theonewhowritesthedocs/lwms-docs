# Location

The location means the Warehouse Code & BIN (if any) information where the stock resides in the inventory.

:::note[INFO]
BIN can be a single bin or sub-levels. [Help documentation in SBO](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_BUSINESS_ONE/68a2e87fb29941b5bf959a184d9c6727/0330174eeddf4eccbe1e3cd2ec041923.html?locale=en-US).

## Hierarchy of Bin Sub-Levels

SAP Business One supports a hierarchy for bin locations through fields like:

- Section.
- Row.
- Level.
- Shelf.

You can configure and activate these sub-levels in the **Bin Location Field Activation** section for warehouses.
