These LPNs are linked to the resource itself and persist over time, regardless of changes in the inventory they contain. Resources are categorized into two distinct types: Transfer Resources and Transport Resources.  Types of Resources:​  Transfer Resources: Resources that handle internal or localized movements of inventory within a warehouse or facility.  Examples: Forklift: An LPN can identify inventory being moved using a forklift.Mobile Cart: A cart used for internal movement in the warehouse.Reusable Pallets/Containers: Reusable items that require consistent identification.Personnel: Instead of the equipment, the person is associated with a permanent LPN for inventory in their possession. This ensures that accountability is tracked even when the inventory is being carried or transported manually. Execution: Transfer Resources execute transfers using Transfer Requests or Transfer Documents.  Transport Resources: Resources that handle the transportation of inventory between facilities, warehouses, or locations that require transportation equipment. Multi-site transfers.Shipping of sold goods to customers.Shipping of purchased goods into site.  Examples: Truck: The LPN tracks inventory temporarily loaded onto a specific truck.Van: Used for smaller transport jobs.Ship/Boat: For long-distance or intercontinental shipments. Execution: Transport Resources execute transfers using Work Orders, which include detailed scheduling and logistics instructions.  Resource Categorization in Master Data​  Each resource is documented in the Resource Master Data under the field &quot;Type of Resource&quot;. The Type of Resource field specifies whether the resource is a: Transfer Resource: Used for internal/localized movement.Transport Resource: Used for inter-facility or long-distance transport.  Key Characteristics​  The LPN remains active for the lifespan of the resource.It is managed as a batch number for &quot;SYSTEM-LPN&quot;.  Example Prefix​  Transfer Resource: PF-001234 Used for resources like forklifts, mobile carts, reusable pallets, or personnel.

Here's how they differ:  Definitions​  SSCC (Serial Shipping Container Code): A globally standardized identifier governed by GS1 standards.Used to uniquely identify a logistic unit (e.g., a pallet, container, or case) across the entire global supply chain.The SSCC is typically a fixed 18-digit number, encoded in GS1-128 barcodes, ensuring consistency and compatibility across trading partners. License Plate Number (LPN): A company-specific identifier assigned to a logistic unit within a warehouse or supply chain system.LPNs are not globally standardized and are defined by individual organizations to track units (e.g., pallets, boxes, or containers) within their own operations.  Purpose​  SSCC: Designed for global supply chain visibility and interoperability.Used for external processes like shipping, receiving, and EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) between trading partners.Ensures every logistic unit can be uniquely tracked across the supply chain, regardless of the company or country. LPN: Primarily used for internal warehouse operations.Helps track and manage the movement of logistic units (pallets, boxes, etc.) within a warehouse or distribution center.May also be used in transport, but it’s not intended for global visibility.  Format​  SSCC: Always follows the GS1 format: § (Extension Digit) + (GS1 Company Prefix) + (Serial Reference) + (Check Digit). § Example: 003123456789123456.Encoded in GS1-128 barcodes. LPN: Format varies based on company preferences and system requirements.It may include alphanumeric characters, prefixes, or even a GS1-structured format if needed (but it’s not required). § Example: LPN-000123456, PAL-001234, or 123456AB.  Usage Context​  SSCC: Used in global logistics and transport processes.Scanned at multiple points in the supply chain, from the point of origin to the final destination.Used in EDI documents such as Advance Shipping Notices (ASNs), invoices, or shipment manifests. LPN: Primarily used in warehouse management systems (WMS) for internal operations.Tracks pallet movement, storage, picking, and packing.May not be recognized or used beyond the company’s internal systems or by trading partners.  Interoperability​  SSCC: Globally unique and universally recognized by all parties that adhere to GS1 standards.Can be shared across systems and trading partners without modification. LPN: Unique only within the company or warehouse environment.Requires mapping or conversion when shared with external systems or partners if interoperability is needed.  Key Benefits​  Aspect\tSSCC\tLPNGlobal Uniqueness\tYes\tNo (Company-Specific) Governance\tStandardized by GS1\tDefined by individual organizations Usage\tExternal (global supply chain)\tInternal (warehouse management) Format\tStrictly GS1-compliant (18 digits)\tFlexible (alphanumeric or numeric) Purpose\tGlobal logistics, EDI, traceability\tInternal tracking, inventory movement  Examples: SSCC: A pallet shipped from Manufacturer A to Retailer B is assigned an SSCC, which is scanned at every stage (e.g., shipping, receiving, storing) for global traceability.LPN: Within Manufacturer A’s warehouse, the pallet is assigned an LPN to track its movement from the receiving dock to storage and later to the shipping dock. The LPN might be converted to an SSCC for external processes.  Key Takeaways​  SSCC: Designed for external, global supply chain tracking. It's a standardized identifier that ensures interoperability between trading partners.LPN: Designed for internal warehouse operations, providing flexibility for companies to define their own structure and use cases.

These LPNs are linked to the resource itself and persist over time, regardless of changes in the inventory they contain. Resources are categorized into two distinct types: Transfer Resources and Transport Resources.  Types of Resources:​  Transfer Resources: Resources that handle internal or localized movements of inventory within a warehouse or facility.  Examples: Forklift: An LPN can identify inventory being moved using a forklift.Mobile Cart: A cart used for internal movement in the warehouse.Reusable Pallets/Containers: Reusable items that require consistent identification.Personnel: Instead of the equipment, the person is associated with a permanent LPN for inventory in their possession. This ensures that accountability is tracked even when the inventory is being carried or transported manually. Execution: Transfer Resources execute transfers using Transfer Requests or Transfer Documents.  Transport Resources: Resources that handle the transportation of inventory between facilities, warehouses, or locations that require transportation equipment. Multi-site transfers.Shipping of sold goods to customers.Shipping of purchased goods into site.  Examples: Truck: The LPN tracks inventory temporarily loaded onto a specific truck.Van: Used for smaller transport jobs.Ship/Boat: For long-distance or intercontinental shipments. Execution: Transport Resources execute transfers using Work Orders, which include detailed scheduling and logistics instructions.  Resource Categorization in Master Data​  Each resource is documented in the Resource Master Data under the field &quot;Type of Resource&quot;. The Type of Resource field specifies whether the resource is a: Transfer Resource: Used for internal/localized movement.Transport Resource: Used for inter-facility or long-distance transport.  Key Characteristics​  The LPN remains active for the lifespan of the resource.It is managed as a batch number for &quot;SYSTEM-LPN&quot;.  Example Prefix​  Transfer Resource: PF-001234 Used for resources like forklifts, mobile carts, reusable pallets, or personnel. Transport Resource: PP-1234 Used for resources like trucks, vans, ships, or other vehicles for inter-facility transport.The final number could be the serial number or the license plate number of the transport resource itself.

Here's how they differ:  Definitions​  SSCC (Serial Shipping Container Code): A globally standardized identifier governed by GS1 standards.Used to uniquely identify a logistic unit (e.g., a pallet, container, or case) across the entire global supply chain.The SSCC is typically a fixed 18-digit number, encoded in GS1-128 barcodes, ensuring consistency and compatibility across trading partners. License Plate Number (LPN): A company-specific identifier assigned to a logistic unit within a warehouse or supply chain system.LPNs are not globally standardized and are defined by individual organizations to track units (e.g., pallets, boxes, or containers) within their own operations.  Purpose​  SSCC: Designed for global supply chain visibility and interoperability.Used for external processes like shipping, receiving, and EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) between trading partners.Ensures every logistic unit can be uniquely tracked across the supply chain, regardless of the company or country. LPN: Primarily used for internal warehouse operations.Helps track and manage the movement of logistic units (pallets, boxes, etc.) within a warehouse or distribution center.May also be used in transport, but it’s not intended for global visibility.  Format​  SSCC: Always follows the GS1 format: § (Extension Digit) + (GS1 Company Prefix) + (Serial Reference) + (Check Digit). § Example: 003123456789123456.Encoded in GS1-128 barcodes. LPN: Format varies based on company preferences and system requirements.It may include alphanumeric characters, prefixes, or even a GS1-structured format if needed (but it’s not required). § Example: LPN-000123456, PAL-001234, or 123456AB.  Usage Context​  SSCC: Used in global logistics and transport processes.Scanned at multiple points in the supply chain, from the point of origin to the final destination.Used in EDI documents such as Advance Shipping Notices (ASNs), invoices, or shipment manifests. LPN: Primarily used in warehouse management systems (WMS) for internal operations.Tracks pallet movement, storage, picking, and packing.May not be recognized or used beyond the company’s internal systems or by trading partners.  Interoperability​  SSCC: Globally unique and universally recognized by all parties that adhere to GS1 standards.Can be shared across systems and trading partners without modification. LPN: Unique only within the company or warehouse environment.Requires mapping or conversion when shared with external systems or partners if interoperability is needed.  Key Benefits​  Aspect\tSSCC\tLPNGlobal Uniqueness\tYes\tNo (Company-Specific) Governance\tStandardized by GS1\tDefined by individual organizations Usage\tExternal (global supply chain)\tInternal (warehouse management) Format\tStrictly GS1-compliant (18 digits)\tFlexible (alphanumeric or numeric) Purpose\tGlobal logistics, EDI, traceability\tInternal tracking, inventory movement  Examples: SSCC: A pallet shipped from Manufacturer A to Retailer B is assigned an SSCC, which is scanned at every stage (e.g., shipping, receiving, storing) for global traceability.LPN: Within Manufacturer A’s warehouse, the pallet is assigned an LPN to track its movement from the receiving dock to storage and later to the shipping dock. The LPN might be converted to an SSCC for external processes.  Key Takeaways​  SSCC: Designed for external, global supply chain tracking. It's a standardized identifier that ensures interoperability between trading partners.LPN: Designed for internal warehouse operations, providing flexibility for companies to define their own structure and use cases.
