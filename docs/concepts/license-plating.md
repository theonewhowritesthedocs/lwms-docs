# License Plating

License plating is the process of assigning a unique identifier, known as a License Plate Number (LPN), to a logistic unit (e.g., pallet, box, container, or other packaging units) to enable efficient tracking and management of inventory. This concept is similar to palletizing, but it is more flexible, as it can apply to various types of logistic units beyond pallets, such as cartons, bins, or containers. License plating consolidates inventory information into a single identifier, simplifying warehouse operations and providing full traceability for logistic units.

## Definition

License plating refers to the practice of grouping items (products, raw materials, or components) into a single logistic unit, assigning it an LPN, and using this identifier to manage, move, and track the unit throughout the supply chain. The LPN acts as a digital tag that stores information about the contents, origin, and destination of the unit, making it a powerful tool for inventory and logistics management.

## Purpose of License Plating

- **Efficiency in Operations**:
  - Reduces manual effort by treating a group of items as a single unit for processes like receiving, putaway, picking, packing, and shipping.
- **Improved Traceability**:
  - Enables quick identification of a unit's contents and history by scanning the LPN.
- **Consolidation**:
  - Combines multiple items, item types, or batches into a single logistic unit for streamlined handling.
- **Flexibility**:
  - Applies to any logistic unit (not just pallets), including cartons, totes, or custom containers.

## How License Plating Works

 - **Assigning an LPN**:
   - A unique License Plate Number is generated and assigned to a logistic unit.
   - The LPN can be alphanumeric (e.g., PAL-001234, BOX-5678) and follows a format defined by the organization.
 - **Linking Data**:
   - The LPN is associated with detailed information about the unit, such as:
     - Item codes and descriptions.
     - Quantities.
     - Batch/Lot numbers.
     - Expiration dates.
     - Dimensions (e.g., width, length, height).
     - Weight.
     - Storage location.
 - **Storing Information**:
   - All relevant data is stored in the Warehouse Management System (WMS) or ERP system, accessible by scanning the LPN barcode.
 - **Tracking Movement**:
   - The LPN is scanned at every stage (e.g., receiving, putaway, picking, packing, shipping), updating the system with the unit's status and location.


## Process of License Plating

 - **Receiving**:
   - When inventory arrives, it is grouped into logistic units (e.g., pallets or boxes).
   - Each unit is assigned an LPN, linking it to the items it contains.
 - **Putaway**:
   - The LPN is scanned to direct the logistic unit to its storage location in the warehouse.
 - **Picking**:
   - During order fulfillment, the LPN is scanned to retrieve the entire unit or its contents.
 - **Packing**:
   - LPNs are used to consolidate items for shipping, ensuring accurate packing and documentation.
 - **Shipping**:
   - The LPN is scanned to confirm the unit is loaded onto the transport vehicle and to generate associated shipping documents (e.g., BOL).

## Key Features of License Plating

- **Unique Identifier**:
  - Each LPN is unique, ensuring no duplication across units.
- **Flexible Application**:
  - Can be applied to pallets, boxes, totes, or containers.
- **Dynamic or Permanent Assignment**:
  - **LPNs can be**:
      - **Temporary**: Assigned for a specific purpose (e.g., picking) and deleted after use.
      - **Permanent**: Assigned to reusable assets like pallets or containers.
- **Barcoding**:
  - LPNs are encoded in barcodes or RFID tags for quick scanning and tracking.
- **Data Consolidation**:
  - All details about the items within the unit are linked to the LPN.

## Benefits of License Plating

 - **Operational Efficiency**:
   - Reduces manual entry and simplifies inventory processes.
   - Treats multiple items as a single unit, reducing handling time.
 - **Enhanced Traceability**:
   - Provides end-to-end visibility of logistic units across the supply chain.
 - **Error Reduction**:
   - Minimizes errors in inventory movement and documentation by automating tracking.
 - **Scalability**:
   - Supports growing operations with flexible grouping and tracking capabilities.
 - **Integration with Systems**:
   - Works seamlessly with WMS and ERP systems to update inventory status in real-time.

## Example of License Plating
Scenario:
A warehouse receives 500 units of an item (SKU: ITEM001) on a pallet.
Steps:
- **The items are grouped into a single pallet**.
- **An LPN is generated for the pallet: PAL-12345**.
- **The WMS links the LPN to the following data**:
  - **Item Code**: ITEM001
  - **Quantity**: 500
  - **Batch Number**: BATCH-6789
  - **Storage Location**: Aisle 10, Rack 3
- **The LPN is scanned at each stage**:
  - **Receiving**: Confirms the pallet is added to inventory.
  - **Putaway**: Directs the pallet to its storage location.
  - **Picking**: Retrieves the pallet for an order.
  - **Shipping**: Confirms the pallet is loaded onto a truck.
