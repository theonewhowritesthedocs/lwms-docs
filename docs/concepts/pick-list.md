# Pick List

A Pick List is a document generated in SAP Business One (SBO) that organizes the inventory items to be picked for transport or fulfillment. It is used to schedule pickups for transferring inventory to a specific destination.

- **Source Documents**: Pick Lists are generated from **Transfer Requests** or **Sales Orders**.
- **Purpose**: Each Pick List corresponds to a specific "Drop-Off" stop or destination. For example, if a truck has three drop-off stops, a separate Pick List is required for each stop.
- **Usage**: The Pick List ensures that the correct items are prepared and ready for transport to their designated destinations, streamlining the logistics process.
