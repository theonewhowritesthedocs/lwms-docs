## Introduction

You have two options: **Assign** and **Depalletize**.

If you want to **assign** stock to new or already existing LPNs, make sure you are in the **Assign** tab and follow from [here](./reassign_lpn.md#assign-createselect-lpn).

If you want to **depalletize** or **unassign** stock from LPNs, make sure you are in the **Depalletize** tab and follow from [here](./reassign_lpn.md#depalletize-select-lpn).

You can switch back and forth whenever you want to do what you need.

## Screens

### Assign: Create/Select LPN

On this screen you can create or select the LPNs that you want to assign stock to.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="create" label="Create LPN" default>
    ![Assign: create/select lpn screen](./img-reassign/assign_create_select_lpn_create_tab.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="select" label="Select LPN">
    ![Assign: create/select lpn screen](./img-reassign/assign_create_select_lpn_select_tab.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<CustomDetails summary="Table Reference">
  | Column | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  |  | Status of the LPN. |
  | License | License Plate Number (LPN). |
  |  | Action button for removing LPNs from the list. |
</CustomDetails>

First, you have to select a **warehouse** and **bin** (if available) to create the LPNS into or to select the LPNs from.

:::note[INFO]
The behavior of the **Location** will vary depending on the **Location linked to personnel ID as the default location** setting in the [Configuration](./reassign_lpn.md#configuration).
:::

Once you do that, the next part of the screen will load below to continue with the LPN creation/selection.

Let's go over the process for **creating** new LPNs. Make sure you are in the **Create** tab.

You need to select the type of LPN you are going to create: **Permanent Transfer** (PF-XXXX), **Permanent Transport** (PP-XXXX), **Temporary** (T-XXXX) and **External** (E-XXXX).

Next, you need to set the **Auto NÂ°** field to the number of LPNs you want to create. LPNs are **auto-incremental**.

Once you are done, click the <IIcon icon="ph:plus-fill" width="17" height="17" /> button to create the number of LPNs you specified. You can find them in the **License Plates** section. Up until this point no actual LPN has been created in the system, it's all locally.

The leftmost column in the table of LPNs will tell you if the LPN is already in the system (**Exist**) or if the LPN is a new one that will be created at the end of the process (**New**).

You can **filter** the list of LPNs using the search box.

You can **remove** any of the LPNs by clicking the <IIcon icon="ic:baseline-delete" width="17" height="17" /> button on the rightmost column.

Now, let's go over the process for **selecting** already existing LPNs. Make sure you are in the **Select** tab.

Click the <IIcon icon='iconamoon:search-bold' width='17' height='17' /> button in the **Select License Plate** field to open the **License Plate Search** modal.

:::note[INFO]
Only LPNs for the location you specified will be shown.
:::

<CustomDetails summary="License Plate Search Modal">

On this screen you need to select one of the **License Plates** listed.

![License plate search modal](./img-reassign/assign_license_plate_search_modal.png)

You can select any item by clicking on it, which will close the modal and take you back with that **License Plate** already set.

You can filter the list of **License Plates** using the search box.

If you want to close the modal without making any changes, click the <IIcon icon="zondicons:close-solid" width="17" height="17"/> button.

</CustomDetails>

You can find all selected LPNs in the **License Plates** section.

Next up is **adding stock** to the LPNs. For that, click on any of the LPNs to go to the [Assign: Add/Modify Stock](./reassign_lpn.md#assign-addmodify-stock) screen, if it's the first time you are editing the LPN, or to the [Assign: Stock Summary](./reassign_lpn.md#assign-addmodify-stock) screen, if it is not the first time.

Once you are done, click **Next** at the bottom to save (**in the system**), which assigns the selected stock to the corresponding LPNs in the specified amount and with the specified batches/serial numbers.

:::note[INFO]
Keep in mind that assigning stock to LPNs creates a **reservation** for the stock and a **GRPO** for the new LPNs under the hood.
:::

At the end, you will get a modal asking you if you want to print the labels. Click **Yes** to print the labels and to start anew, or **No** to just start anew.

:::note[INFO]
All printed labels can be found in the ```/PDF/PO/``` folder for the project.
:::
