## Screens

### Option: Select Carrier

:::info
This screen is only shown if **Check if the Transfer Request document has a Truck Log linked** <u>is not</u> checked in the [**Configuration**](./shipping_multi_site_transfer.md#configuration).
:::

On this screen you have the option of deciding if you want to specify a **carrier** or not.

![Option: Select carrier screen](./img-shipping-multi-site-transfer/decision_carrier_selection_screen.png)

If you choose **Yes**, you will be taken to the [Carrier Selection](./shipping_multi_site_transfer.md#carrier-selection) screen.

If you choose **No**, you will be taken to the [Transfer Request Selection](./shipping_multi_site_transfer.md#transfer-request-selection) screen.

### Carrier Selection

On this screen you need to select a **carrier**.

### Carrier PO Selection

On this screen you need to select a **carrier purchase order** associated with the carrier you previously chose.

The exact screen you will see will depend on the **Check if the Transfer Request document has a Truck Log linked** option in the [Configuration](./shipping_multi_site_transfer.md#configuration):

1. <u>**Truck Log Checked**</u>: The **Check if the Transfer Request document has a Truck Log linked** option <u>is</u> checked. This will only give you the option for selecting a **Carrier Purchase Order**.
2. <u>**Truck Log Not Checked**</u>: The **Check if the Transfer Request document has a Truck Log linked** option <u>is not</u> checked. This will give you both options, selecting a **Carrier Purchase Order** and creating a **Goods Receipt Purchase Order**. The options are <u>mutually exclusive</u>.

### GRPO Creation

On this screen you need to create a **GRPO**. This is an <u>alternative</u> to a **Carrier Purchase Order**.

![GRPO creation screen](./img-shipping-delivery/grpo_generation_screen.png)

The **Carrier Company** comes from the previous screen and the **Item No** comes from the **Item to generate the Carrier Goods Receipt PO** option in the [Configuration](./shipping_multi_site_transfer.md#configuration). These fields <u>are not</u> editable.

By default, the **Warehouse** and **Bin Location** will be the location of the personnel in the system, <u>only if</u> the **Location linked to personnel ID as the default location** option <u>is</u> checked in the [Configuration](./shipping_multi_site_transfer.md#configuration).

</CustomDetails>

Next up is the **Batch/Serial Number**. This one is not enabled because for this specific procedure the **Item No** is not supposed to be managed by a batch/serial number, due to its nature.

<!-- NOTE: When enabled, the batch field allows the user to type in any value and that gives an error later when trying to create the GRPO  -->

And last but no least you have the **Quantity**. Set it to the value you see fit.

Once you are done, click **Save** at the bottom to create the **Goods Receipt Purchase Order** and to go to the [Transfer Request Selection](./shipping_multi_site_transfer.md#transfer-request-selection) screen.
